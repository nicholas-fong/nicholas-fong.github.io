Sure! You can use ES6 features such as const, let, arrow functions, and 
EventListener to make your code more modern and efficient. 

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your JavaScript code to use these features.


In this code:

const and let are used instead of var for declaring variables.

Arrow functions are used for the calculateCompoundInterest and handleFormSubmit functions.

EventListener is added to the button for the click event.

Template literals are used for string interpolation in the result output.


This makes your code more modern, cleaner, and adheres to ES6 standards.
